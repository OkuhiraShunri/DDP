2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1 input JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1 input JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1 output JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1 multiplier stage JOIN_DDP/FP/ALU1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

LUTLP-2#1 Warning
Combinatorial Loop Allowed  
2 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. This loop has been identified in the constraints as being known and understood by use of the ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS property on a net in the loop. The cells in the loop are: JOIN_DDP/COPY/cx2/nor1_out_inferred_i_1
JOIN_DDP/COPY/cx2/nor2_out_inferred_i_1.
Related violations: <none>

LUTLP-2#2 Warning
Combinatorial Loop Allowed
