ERROR: [Place 30-487] The packing of instances into the device could not be obeyed. There are a total of 4400 slices in the device, of which 4254 slices are available, however, the unplaced instances require 4875 slices. Please analyze your design to determine if the number of LUTs, FFs, and/or control sets can be reduced.

Number of control sets and instances constrained to the design
	Control sets: 4880
	Luts: 8005 (combined) 8059 (total), available capacity: 17600 
	Flip flops: 7802, available capacity: 35200
	NOTE: each slice can only accommodate 1 unique control set so FFs cannot be packed to fully fill every slice
